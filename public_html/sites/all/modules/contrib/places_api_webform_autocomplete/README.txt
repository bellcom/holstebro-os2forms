CONFIGURATION
-------------

First ensure Google Places API autocomplete and Webform modules are installed,
and Google Places API autocomplete is configured with a Google API key.

Once that is done, when creating new webform components you will be able to add
a 'Google Places Autocomplete' component to your webforms. All of the options 
available to Google Places API autocomplete are available to the new webform
component.
