-- SUMMARY --

This module allows you to add html5 autofill (autocomplete) attributes to your 
form elements. These are part of the WHATWG HTML standard and are implemented 
by some modern browsers such as chrome. This helps the browser understand how 
to fill in the element to ensure an optimum autofill experience for your 
end users.
